    "# Morphological analysis with FSTs\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a brief and basic tutorial on how to construct a morphological analyzer for a language using finite-state techniques. A small toy grammar of English noun and verb inflection is built step-by-step to illustrate overall design issues. While the grammar is small, much larger grammars can be built using the same design principles. Basic familiarity with regular expressions and __PyFoma__ is assumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a \"morphological analyzer\" could mean any number of things, let's first settle on a task description and define what the morphological analyzer is supposed to accomplish. In this implementation, a morphological analyzer is taken to be a black box (as in Fig. 1), which happens to be implemented as a finite-state transducer, that translates word forms (such as `runs`) into a string that represents its morphological makeup, such as `run[V][3p][Sg]`: a verb in the third person singular present tense.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Morphological analyzer example](./images/analyzerexample1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, if the word form is ambiguous (as `runs` is), the job of the analyzer is to output all tag sequences consistent with the grammar and the input word. In the above example, the transducer should perhaps also output `run[N][Pl]`, or some similar sequence to convey the possibility of a noun reading of `runs`. Since finite-state transducers are inherently bidirectional devices, i.e. we can run a transducer in the inverse direction as well as the forward direction, the same FST, once we've built it, can serve *both as a generator and an analyzer*. The standard practice is to build morphological transducers so that the input (or domain) side is the analysis side, and the output (or range) side contains the concrete word forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real life, morphological analyzers tend to provide much more detailed information than this. Figure 2 shows a more elaborate analyzer's output for Basque with the input work `maiatzaren`, together with an illustration about how a feature matrix can be recovered from the string output of the analyzer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Morphological analyzer example](./images/maiatzaren.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is then is build a finite-state transducer that accomplishes this string-to-string mapping of analyses to surface forms and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The construction of the final transducer will be broken down into two large components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A lexicon/morphotactics part\n",
    "* A phonological/morphophonological/orthographic part\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Lexicon\n",
    "\n",
    "The first component, which we call the lexicon component, will be a transducer that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Accepts as input only the valid stems/lemmas of the language, followed by only a legal sequence of tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Produces as output from these, an intermediate form, where the tags are replaced by the morphemes that they correspond to.\n",
    "\n",
    "* May produce additional symbols in the output, such as special symbols that serve to mark the presence of morpheme boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For example, in the analyzer about to be constructed, the lexicon component FST will perform the following mappings:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "c a t [N] [Pl]      w a t c h [N] [Pl]     w a t c h [V] [3P] [Sg]   (input side)\n",
    "c a t +   s         w a t c h +   s        w a t c h +   s           (output side)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two things to note here. The first is that we are using the symbol `+` to mark a morpheme boundary. The second is that while each letter in the stem is represented by its own symbol (`w`,`a`,`t`,`c`,`h`, etc.), each complete tag is one separate symbol, a multicharacter symbol (`[N]`, `[Pl]`, etc.) The spaces in the above show the symbol boundaries to illustrate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The part that accomplishes this, the lexicon transducer, will be written as a __right-linear grammar__ (using the `rlg` method of the `FST` class). While it is possible to construct the lexicon transducer through regular expressions in __PyFoma__, the `rlg` is more suited for lexicon construction and expressing morphotactics in a legible fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternation rules\n",
    "\n",
    "The role of the alternation rules is to modify the output of the lexicon transducer according to orthographic, phonological, and morphophonological rules and conventions. So far, for example, we've assumed that English nouns can be pluralized by concatenating the morpheme `s` with the stem (`cat` → `cats`). However, some nouns, those where the stem ends in a sibilant, have the allomorph `es` (`watch` → `watches`). A way to describe the process of forming correct nouns is to consistently represent the plural as the morpheme `s` as we have, and then subject these word forms to alternation rules that insert an `e` in the right place only if the stem ends in a sibilant. This, among others, is the task of the alternation rules component: to produce the valid surface forms from the intermediate forms output by the lexicon transducer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since alternation rule FSTs that are conditioned by their environment are very difficult to construct by hand, we use the rewrite rules formalism in __PyFoma__ (`$^rewrite()`) to compile the necessary rules into FSTs.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the necessary replacement rules have been built, we compose together the lexicon FST and these various FSTs that encode such alternations as `e`-insertions, producing one large transducer that acts like a cascade - a single transducer that has the same effect as would providing an input word to the lexicon transducer, take its output and feed it into the first rule transducer, take it's output, then feed it into the next rule transducer, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is accomplished by the regular expression composition operator (`@`). Suppose we have the lexicon transducer in an FST we've named `Lexicon`, and the various alternation rules as FSTs named `rule_1`, ..., `rule_n` (in reality we might want to use more perspicuous names). Now, we can issue the regular expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "FST.re(\"$Lexicon @ $rule_1 @ ... @ $rule_n\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and produce a single transducer that is the composite of the different rule transducers and the lexicon transducer.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Composite analyzer / generator](./images/compositeanalyzergenerator.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is indeed one of the main reasons to use finite-state transducers for morphological analysis: the fact that we can describe the word-formation rules in the direction of generation, but in fact use the final FST in the other direction. It would be trivial to write little programs (in one's programming language of choice) to perform the lexicon mapping and the alternation rules mappings, each little program's output being fed as the next program's input, and so provide a model for *generation*. But with such a program, we generally have no way to perform analysis, and would need to implement that separately. The fact that we can calculate the composition of each individual transducer, is what makes this possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we write the grammar in the direction of generation, we at the same time produce an analyzer, or parser. This is because the final product is represented as one single transducer and transducers operate just as easily in the inverse direction. All the software has to do when parsing (applying the transducer in the inverse direction), is to follow the output labels on each transition that correspond to the word to parsed, and output the matching input labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The lexicon\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, the lexicon script that will be a transducer that maps analysis forms to intermediate forms will be written in the `rlg`-formalism.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The facts to be modeled\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving further, let's narrow down the details we want to capture in our analyzer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll want to include the following noun/verb features into the grammar.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Nouns: singular (cat) vs. plural (cats)\n",
    "* Verbs: infinitive (watch), 3rd person singular (watches), past tense (watched), past participle (watched), and present participle (watching)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also want to use the following tags for marking the above grammatical information.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `[N]` for nouns\n",
    "* `[V]` for verbs\n",
    "* `[3P]` for third person\n",
    "* `[Sg]` for singular forms\n",
    "* `[Pl]` for plural forms\n",
    "* `[Past]` for past tense\n",
    "* `[Past] [Part]` for past participle\n",
    "* `[Pres] [Part]` for present participle\n",
    "\n",
    "## The right-linear grammar\n",
    "\n",
    "A [right-linear grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_grammar) is a formalism for generating strings using a grammar of rewrite rules (not to be confused with the rewrite rules we'll later use for morphophonology). Each rule consists of (1) exactly one non-terminal symbol on the left hand side (of the arrow), and the right-hand sides consist of (2) zero or more terminal symbols followed by (3) at most one non-terminal symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a simple right-linear grammar that generates the strings `{cat, dog, cats, dogs, walk, buy, sell, buying, selling}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Right-linear grammar](./images/rlg1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "All right-linear grammars are expressible as automata and vice versa, and the purpose of the compilation is to convert our right-linear grammar to an automaton (or transducer - more on that below). For example, this automaton models exactly the same set of words as the grammar above generates:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Automaton from right-linear grammar](./images/rlg2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Right-linear grammars with input and output\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we not only want to generate the legal configuration of morphemes, but also to map morphemes' tags on the input side of a transduction to the actual morphemes, the right-linear grammar formalism allows for specification of different inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is our grammar written in formal notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "S → &#x03f5; Noun | &#x03f5; Verb\n",
    "Noun → cat NInfl | city NInfl | box NInfl | panic NInfl | try NInfl | watch NInfl\n",
    "Verb → beg VInfl | box VInfl | fake VInfl | panic VInfl | try VINfl | watch VInfl\n",
    "NInfl → ([N] [Sg]):&#x03f5; # | ([N] [Pl]):+s #\n",
    "VInfl → ([V]):&#x03f5; # | ([V] [3P] [Sg]):+s # | ([V] [Past]):+ed # | ([V] [Past] [Part]):+ed # |\n",
    "        ([V] [Pres] [Part]):+ing # \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the `NInfl` and `VInfl` nonterminals which expand into a sequence of tags on the input side, corresponding to morphemes (such as `+ing` or `+ed` or `+s`) on the output side. A special nonterminal `#` denotes end-of-generation and must always be present when a derivation ends.\n",
    "\n",

    "Here, all the grammar rules are put into a dictionary, which is arbitrarily called `Grammar`. Each key in the dictionary is a left-hand-side of a rule, and the corresponding value is a tuple/iterable of possible right-hand-sides. If the input is different from the output (as on lines 9-13) the right-hand side nonterminals are represented as 2-tuples like `(\"'[N]' '[Sg]'\", \"\")`. The tag symbols `[N]` `[V]` etc. are quoted so that they become single atomic symbols in the resulting automaton (and not a sequence `[` `N` `]` or `[` `V` `]`). This is common practice when designing morphological transducers - tags are multicharacter symbols while actual word forms are concatenations of alphabetic symbols, e.g. `c` `a` `t`.\n",
    "\n",

The latter word fulfills the structural requirements of the rewrite rule (a `C V`-sequence before the consonant to be doubled), yet the gemination isn't permitted. To handle such idiosyncracies in English, one would have to add information about stress in the lexicon. Perhaps `commit` would be represented as `com'mit` and `edit` as `'edit` which would reveal whether the stem-final syllable is stressed. The stress information could then be used in the gemination rule, after which the stress symbols could be deleted."

This is tricky to manage in a clean way. The second problem is that we don't want this restriction to apply in the case of *do* because *undo* is perfectly okay. \n",

    "\n",
    "During application of a transducer, the runtime of foma will decide whether or not a word is to be accepted depending on which flags co-occur in the same word. A good way to handle co-occurrence problems is generally to drop suitable flags by certain morphemes, which then prevents them from combining, but leaving the flags invisible to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a short description of different flag diacritics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `[[$VAR=VAL]]` – set variable `$VAR` to value `VAL`\n",
    "* `[[$VAR=]]` – unset variable `$VAR`\n",
    "* `[[$VAR?=VAL]]` – unify variable `$VAR` with value `VAL`. This flag fails if `$VAR` has been set to a different value than `VAL`. As a consequence of this flag, `$VAR` will be set to value `VAL`.\n",
    "* `[[$VAR==VAL]]` – check that `$VAR` has been set to value `VAL`\n",

    "It's important to ensure that flags appear both on the upper and lower side and that they are aligned. Using a separate flag nonterminal, like `PrefixFlag` above, can be a tidy way to accomplish this. However, nothing prevents you from adding them to entries like `do`. If you do, it's often a good idea to have flag dicritics as the first symbol in the entry to ensure that the upper and lower-level diacritic are aligned.\n",

    "The flags in this grammar interact as follows to capture the phenomena we require:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prefix *un-* gives the value `On` to the variable `UN` (`[[$UN=On]]`, assign)\n",
    "* The bare infinitive forbids the variable `UN` from having a value (`[[!$UN]]` disallow)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, this leads to that, even though lexc generates the combination:\n",
    "\n",
    "```[[$Un=On]]undrink[[!$Un]]```\n",
    "\n",
    "the apply runtime sees that the variable `Un` was first set to `On`, and later in the same string forbidden from having that value, thus blocking this word. This gets us almost everything, with the exception that we want to allow *undo*, unlike the two other un-VERB combinations. That is handled by the `[[$Un=]]`-flag, which unsets `$Un`. For that particular combination, lexc generates:\n",
    "\n",
    "```[[$Un=On]]un[[$Un=]]do[[!$Un]]```\n",
    "\n",
    "And in this case, the runtime flag-watcher has no problem accepting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "No special meaning is attached to the value `On`. You are free to use any values you like. "
