As a tool, PyFoma is unrelated to the `foma <https://fomafst.github.io>`_ compiler, which is implemented in C and uses the Xerox formalism for regular expressions and which has its own Python extensions, but it inherits many of its FSM construction algorithms. The regular expression formalism is influenced by `The Kleene Programming Language <http://www.kleene-lang.org/>`_.
